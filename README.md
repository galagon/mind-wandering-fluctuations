Evidence from an experience sampling study". Full materials are also available on the study's OSF project page: https://osf.io/es3gf/


## Organization

* `prepped_orig_data`: csv file containing all original data (Study 1 in the article). Data were previously prepared by reorganizing columns, deleting unecessary columns, and assigning convenient ID values.
* `prepped_rean_data`: csv file containing all reanalysed data previously used in Mills, Raffaelli, Irving, Stan, and Christoff (2017) (Study 2 in the article). Data were previously prepared by reorganizing columns, deleting unecessary columns, and assigning convenient ID values.
* `mind-wandering-fluctuation`: R Markdown file that contains the code to reproduce all analyses, values for tables, and graphics (with the exception of Figure 1 which was not data-derived).
